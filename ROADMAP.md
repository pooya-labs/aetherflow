# AetherFlow — Master Roadmap

This file is the **source of truth** for project progress. If a chat or network session is interrupted, resume from **Current checkpoint** and the first unchecked task in the active phase.

Last updated: 2026-11-02  
Current branch: `main`  
Current milestone: **M01 — Rust workspace foundation**  
Overall status: **In progress; hosted CI verification pending**

## Progress rules

- [x] Create this persistent roadmap in the repository.
- [x] Check tasks only after the artifact exists; verification tasks require an actual run.
- [x] Record exact commands and outcomes; never mark an unrun test as passing.
- [x] Keep this file current at every milestone boundary and before ending a work session.
- [x] Prefer small, reviewable commits and explicit limitations.
- [x] Record blockers, assumptions, and manual actions explicitly.

## Milestones

### M00 — Project charter and architecture baseline
- [x] Confirm public repository and write access.
- [x] Define project purpose, non-goals, and initial technology direction.
- [x] Establish persistent roadmap and recovery protocol.
- [x] Add architecture overview.
- [x] Record ADR-0001: Rust-first modular core.
- [x] Add contribution and security guidance.
- [ ] Select and add an explicit open-source license.
- [x] Review scope and first implementation boundary.

### M01 — Rust workspace foundation
- [x] Pin Rust toolchain (1.99.1) and create workspace manifest.
- [x] Establish initial crate boundaries: infrastructure-independent core and server application.
- [x] Add formatting, Clippy, and test conventions.
- [x] Add CI for formatting, Clippy, unit tests, build, and documentation.
- [x] Add minimal executable and bootstrap HTTP health endpoint.
- [ ] Verify clean build and all checks from a fresh checkout via hosted CI.

### M02 — Execution domain and state machine
- [ ] Define workflow, run, task, attempt, and worker identities.
- [ ] Specify lifecycle states and legal transitions.
- [ ] Define retry, timeout, cancellation, and idempotency contracts.
- [ ] Implement deterministic transition tests and property-based tests.
- [ ] Document failure semantics and invariants.

### M03 — Single-node execution runtime
- [ ] Implement in-memory repository for deterministic tests.
- [ ] Implement bounded async scheduler and worker loop.
- [ ] Add task registration and workflow execution API.
- [ ] Add concurrency limits, deadlines, cancellation, and retry policy.
- [ ] Add integration tests for success and failure paths.

### M04 — Durable persistence
- [ ] Design PostgreSQL schema and migration strategy.
- [ ] Implement transactional state transitions.
- [ ] Implement claim/lease/heartbeat semantics.
- [ ] Implement recovery after process restart.
- [ ] Add crash-window and duplicate-delivery tests.

### M05 — Distributed coordination and event delivery
- [ ] Define node membership and worker ownership model.
- [ ] Add transactional outbox/inbox where required.
- [ ] Integrate NATS JetStream after transport-independent contracts stabilize.
- [ ] Test redelivery, lease expiry, partition, and worker loss.
- [ ] Document delivery guarantees and operational limits.

### M06 — WASM extension runtime
- [ ] Define versioned plugin ABI and capability model.
- [ ] Integrate Wasmtime with fuel, memory, and execution limits.
- [ ] Add host-call authorization and deterministic error mapping.
- [ ] Test traps, resource exhaustion, and untrusted modules.
- [ ] Publish a minimal plugin example.

### M07 — Control plane and developer experience
- [ ] Expose versioned HTTP API and OpenAPI contract.
- [ ] Add CLI for inspect, submit, cancel, and worker status.
- [ ] Add Rust SDK; add TypeScript SDK only when API stabilizes.
- [ ] Build dashboard for workflows, runs, tasks, and event history.
- [ ] Add authentication, authorization, and tenant isolation design.

### M08 — Production engineering
- [ ] Add structured logs, metrics, and distributed tracing.
- [ ] Add Docker Compose development environment.
- [ ] Add backup/restore and schema upgrade runbooks.
- [ ] Add reproducible load and benchmark suites.
- [ ] Add chaos/failure-injection scenarios.
- [ ] Add dependency, license, secret, and supply-chain checks.
- [ ] Publish threat model, SLO proposal, and operational guide.

### M09 — Release candidate
- [ ] Complete end-to-end acceptance suite.
- [ ] Verify clean install and documented quickstart.
- [ ] Review API stability and compatibility policy.
- [ ] Publish limitations and known issues.
- [ ] Tag a version only after release criteria pass.

## Current checkpoint

**Completed:** M00 architecture baseline except owner license selection. M01 workspace, pinned toolchain, core crate, bootstrap server, development guide, and CI workflow are committed to `main`.  
**In progress:** M01 verification.  
**Next action:** Inspect hosted CI result; fix any format, lint, build, or test failures before starting M02.  
**Verification:** CI workflow exists and has been triggered. Latest observed run for commit `583c3538e8253eacc3eacad4685112f5f48ae18a` was pending at the time of this update. Local Rust compilation was not possible in this environment because `rustc` is not installed.  
**Known limitation:** Bootstrap HTTP server is sequential and intentionally not production-ready.  
**Blockers:** Hosted CI result pending. License selection remains with repository owner.  
**Manual action required from owner:** Choose a project license before public release; no legal terms have been assumed.

## Session log
