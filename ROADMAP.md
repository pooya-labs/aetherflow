# AetherFlow — Master Roadmap

This file is the **source of truth** for project progress. If a chat or network session is interrupted, resume from **Current checkpoint** and the first unchecked task in the active phase.

Last updated: 2026-11-02  
Current branch: `main`  
Current milestone: **M04 — Durable persistence**  
Overall status: **M04 in progress; M00–M03 complete and hosted-verified**

## Progress rules

- [x] Create this persistent roadmap in the repository.
- [x] Check tasks only after the artifact exists; verification tasks require an actual run.
- [x] Record exact commands and outcomes; never mark an unrun test as passing.
- [x] Keep this file current at every milestone boundary and before ending a work session.
- [x] Prefer small, reviewable commits and explicit limitations.
- [x] Record blockers, assumptions, and manual actions explicitly.

### M04 — Durable persistence
- [x] Design PostgreSQL v1 schema and immutable migration/checksum strategy for workflow/task runs, ordered dependencies, attempts, leases/fencing, and outbox (ADR-0007).
- [x] Select and pin deadpool-postgres 0.14.2, tokio-postgres 0.7.18, serde_json 1.0.154, and sha2 0.10.9 while retaining Rust 1.85 MSRV.
- [x] Add PostgreSQL 18 service to CI and execute DDL against a real server (run `41365026199`).

- [x] Implement transactional retryable/permanent worker-failure recording with typed `TaskFailure`, attempt history, and outbox events (PostgreSQL 18 run `41367694624`; Rust CI run `41367694577`).

- [x] Aggregate task outcomes into durable workflow-run terminal status; require all tasks to succeed for workflow success, and cancel remaining queued/running tasks plus active attempts on failure, cancellation, or timeout (PostgreSQL 18 run `41367694624`).
- [x] Implement durable outbox claim/retry/ack APIs with leased claims, monotonically increasing claim tokens, and stale-publisher rejection (PostgreSQL 18 runs `41366887867` and `41367694624`).
- [x] Add a transport-neutral PostgreSQL outbox dispatcher: publish outside transactions, ack only after publisher success, retry failures with capped exponential backoff, and preserve claim-token fencing (PostgreSQL 18 run `41370357722`; Rust CI `41370357767`).
- [ ] Integrate a real broker publisher and idempotent inbox/consumer deduplication; verify publish/ack crash-window redelivery.
- [x] Add a process-restart integration test that drops the original pool/repository and starts a separate OS test process to recover an expired lease, reclaim with a higher fencing token, and finish the task (PostgreSQL 18 run `41368104662`).
- [x] Inject an outbox insert failure in PostgreSQL 18 and prove task state, attempt outcome, and event insertion roll back atomically; after removing the failing constraint, the same valid claim completes successfully (PostgreSQL 18 run `41368359268`; Rust CI run `41368358899`).
- [x] Connect `PgWorkflowCoordinator` and `PostgresTaskWorker` to the shared runtime `TaskRegistry`/`TaskContext`: materialize deterministic task-run IDs from validated DAGs, execute with bounded concurrency, PostgreSQL leases/heartbeats/fencing, durable retries/timeouts, dependency outputs, and automatic workflow aggregation (Rust CI `41369526772`; PostgreSQL 18 `41369526661`).
- [ ] Test process termination across database commit and broker publish/ack crash windows.

### M05 — Distributed coordination and event delivery

## Current checkpoint

**Completed:** M00 architecture baseline except owner license selection. M01 Rust workspace foundation is hosted-verified (run `41353166515`). M02 includes typed execution identities (including idempotency keys), explicit lifecycle graphs, versioned transitions, capped exponential retry calculation, exhaustive transition matrices, and ADR-0002. M03 single-node runtime is complete and hosted-verified: in-memory repository, bounded Tokio scheduler, deterministic DAG validation, workflow-run coordinator, cooperative cancellation, bounded two-stage shutdown, 1 MiB input/output payloads, and successful direct-dependency output access.

**In progress:** M04 durable persistence. PostgreSQL 18 schema, immutable migration runner, durable task repository, workflow materializer, and async PostgreSQL worker are verified. `PgWorkflowCoordinator` converts a validated runtime DAG into deterministic durable task-run IDs and dependency rows. `PostgresTaskWorker` reuses the runtime handler registry and backend-neutral `TaskContext`, executes with bounded concurrency, claims and heartbeats database-owned leases, settles typed success/failure/timeout with fencing, loads direct dependency outputs, recovers expired leases, and automatically aggregates workflow state after task outcomes. Workflow aggregation succeeds only after every task succeeds; a terminal failure/cancellation/timeout cancels remaining non-terminal task runs and closes active attempts in the same transaction as task/workflow outbox events.

**Next action:** Implement a concrete broker adapter (NATS JetStream only after the transport contract is stable) and a durable consumer inbox/deduplication table keyed by stable event ID. Then test process termination after database commit, after broker acceptance but before outbox ack, and during consumer handling. The generic PostgreSQL dispatcher, worker/coordinator path, fresh-process lease recovery, and rollback on outbox insert failure are verified. Preserve database-owned lease/deadline time and never persist process-local monotonic timestamps.

**Verification:** Latest generic outbox-dispatch verification: Rust CI `41370357767` and PostgreSQL 18 CI `41370357722` passed. The integration test injects one publisher failure, verifies the event is rescheduled, then publishes the same event ID successfully and confirms PostgreSQL persisted `publish_attempts = 2`, `claim_token = 2`, and `published_at` with no active claim. Worker/coordinator verification remains Rust `41369526772` and PostgreSQL `41369526661`; the two-task DAG executes through `PostgresTaskWorker`, the child receives persisted root output, and the workflow reaches `succeeded`. The same PostgreSQL run includes typed failure, cancellation/timeout, workflow aggregation, outbox fencing/rollback, and subprocess lease-recovery scenarios. Earlier durable persistence foundations remain: outbox rollback `41368358899`/`41368359268`; subprocess recovery Rust `41368104908` and PostgreSQL `41368104662`; M04 task lifecycle Rust `41367694577` and PostgreSQL `41367694624`; M01 `41353166515`; M03 runtime milestones `41353963000`, `41354805491`, `41355173212`, `41356396516`, `41357065422`, `41357506821`, `41358509174`, and `41359053561`; PostgreSQL migration hardening `41362986570`; and the original PostgreSQL vertical slice `41365026199`.

**Known limitations:** The durable worker is an opt-in PostgreSQL worker loop; the existing `TaskScheduler` remains the process-local development/test scheduler. The generic `OutboxPublisher` contract and PostgreSQL dispatcher are implemented, but no production broker adapter or consumer inbox/deduplication exists yet. The current integration test uses a deterministic fake publisher; process termination around commit/publish/ack and broader coordinator restart tests remain outstanding. Shutdown drains handlers, then signals cooperative cancellation and may abort stragglers; their durable leases are recovered after expiry rather than being force-marked cancelled. Handler cancellation cannot undo external effects already issued; delivery is at-least-once and consumers must deduplicate by stable event ID. Task payloads remain opaque bytes capped at 1 MiB; applications own encoding and schema compatibility.

**Blockers:** The remaining M04 work is implementation and verification, not a schema/driver blocker. License selection remains with repository owner.

**Manual action required from owner:** Choose a project license before public release; no legal terms have been assumed.
