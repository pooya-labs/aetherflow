# AetherFlow

**A durable, distributed workflow execution platform built with Rust.**

AetherFlow is a public engineering project exploring reliable asynchronous execution across processes and machines. Its design centers on durable state transitions, explicit execution semantics, recoverable workers, and observable operations.

> **Project status:** M00–M06 are complete. M07 now includes platform and tenant-authenticated Axum routes, tenant-scoped task/workflow storage, grant-gated workers and event processing, PostgreSQL migrations v4–v6, forced RLS on ten tenant-owned tables, and separate migration-owner/runtime database pools. These newer changes and their integration tests are committed but await hosted verification on the current source tree. The listener remains loopback-only; HTTPS, CLI/SDK, dashboard, and operational hardening remain open. AetherFlow is experimental and is not production-ready.

## Why AetherFlow?

Distributed work is easy to start and hard to make reliable. Processes crash, networks partition, workers disappear, messages are delivered more than once, and external side effects cannot always be rolled back. AetherFlow aims to make these realities explicit rather than hiding them behind a simplistic task queue.

## Design goals

- Durable workflow and task state with auditable transitions.
- At-least-once delivery paired with idempotent execution primitives.
- Recoverable workers using leases, heartbeats, and bounded retries.
- Explicit cancellation, timeout, concurrency, and backpressure semantics.
- A modular Rust core with async execution.
- A sandboxed WebAssembly extension boundary.
- Operational visibility through structured events, metrics, and traces.
- Reproducible tests for failure and recovery behavior.

AetherFlow will **not** claim universal exactly-once execution. External side effects require application-level idempotency or an explicit transactional integration.

## Planned technology

| Area | Direction |
|---|---|
| Core | Rust, Tokio |
| HTTP control API | Axum (v1 control-plane routes implemented in M07) |
| RPC | Tonic / gRPC (when justified) |
| Durable storage | PostgreSQL |
| Event transport | NATS JetStream (after core semantics are proven) |
| Extensions | Wasmtime |
| Observability | OpenTelemetry |
| Dashboard | TypeScript UI (later phase) |
| Deployment | Docker Compose; Kubernetes only after operational needs are demonstrated |

Technology choices are provisional until validated by implementation and recorded in architecture decision records.

## API contract

The versioned v1 control-plane API is implemented in apps/aetherflow-server and described by the [OpenAPI 3.1 specification](docs/api/openapi.yaml). Its routes are:

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | /health | Process liveness; does not check PostgreSQL |
| POST | /api/v1/workflow-runs | Validate and durably submit a workflow-run snapshot |
| GET | /api/v1/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id} | Read a workflow run and its task summaries |
| GET | /api/v1/task-runs/{task_run_id} | Read task state and payload-size metadata |
| POST | /api/v1/task-runs/{task_run_id}/cancel | Cancel with an expected_version guard |
| GET | /api/v1/workers | List live active worker registrations (platform operator) |
| POST | /api/v1/tenant/workflow-runs | Submit a workflow for the authenticated tenant |
| GET | /api/v1/tenant/workflow-runs/{workflow_run_id} | Read a tenant-owned workflow |
| GET | /api/v1/tenant/task-runs/{task_run_id} | Read a tenant-owned task |
| POST | /api/v1/tenant/task-runs/{task_run_id}/cancel | Cancel a tenant-owned task with an expected_version guard |

The contract and its compatibility/security decisions are recorded in [ADR-0010](docs/decisions/0010-versioned-control-plane-api.md). Task input is base64 encoded and limited to 1 MiB after decoding; the HTTP request body is capped at 2 MiB. Inspection responses never return task input or output bytes. Reusing a workflow-run ID returns a conflict; the v1 API does not promise idempotent replay.

**Security boundary:** `AETHERFLOW_API_TOKEN` protects the platform/operator compatibility routes; tenant routes authenticate separately against stored tenant credentials and derive tenant identity server-side. `AETHERFLOW_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` is the DDL/migration owner pool; `DATABASE_URL` must be a restricted non-owner runtime role with no SUPERUSER, BYPASSRLS, CREATEROLE, CREATEDB, protected-table ownership, public-schema CREATE, REPLICATION, or membership in any other PostgreSQL role. Startup verifies this role and ENABLE + FORCE RLS on all ten protected tables. PostgreSQL uses Rustls with native CA roots and requires TLS by default. The HTTP listener still defaults to 127.0.0.1:8080 and rejects non-loopback binds; PostgreSQL TLS does not provide HTTP HTTPS. Do not expose it to an untrusted network. Transaction-local RLS GUCs are app-controlled context and do not protect against arbitrary SQL execution or SQL injection.

## Repository map

The repository is being built incrementally. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the authoritative checklist and current checkpoint, [docs/architecture/overview.md](docs/architecture/overview.md) for system boundaries, [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/) for architecture decisions, and [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for local commands.

## Development status

M00–M06 are complete and hosted-verified. M07's HTTP control plane, tenant credential routes, tenant-scoped repository paths, worker grants, tenant-aware outbox/inbox, and forced-RLS schema are implemented. Migrations v5/v6, RLS policies, the real `SET ROLE` regression suite, the server's restricted-role verifier, and recent tenant changes await hosted CI on the exact latest source SHA. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the authoritative verification state.

The tenant routes support workflow submission/read and task read/cancel with explicit Read/Submit/Cancel role checks. Platform/operator routes remain separate. Workflow definitions are submitted as snapshots rather than stored as reusable versioned definitions. Duplicate workflow-run IDs return 409; v1 does not promise idempotent replay.

The database pools are intentionally separate: `AETHERFLOW_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` is the migration-owner URL; `DATABASE_URL` is the restricted runtime URL. The server refuses an owner, superuser, BYPASSRLS, CREATEROLE, CREATEDB, or owner/bypass-member runtime role and refuses startup unless all protected tables have FORCE RLS. Keep HTTP loopback-only until HTTPS, negative TLS tests, and a threat-model review are complete.

The latest verified implementation and remaining M07 work are tracked in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). License selection remains an owner-only release decision, and property-based lifecycle tests remain deferred engineering debt.

## Persistence status

The PostgreSQL storage crate and initial schema have passed PostgreSQL 18 CI. Durable handler failure recording, task cancellation/timeout, workflow terminal aggregation, and outbox claim/retry/ack are implemented and integration-tested. Workflow aggregation succeeds only when all tasks succeed; on a terminal failure, cancellation, or timeout it cancels remaining non-terminal tasks and closes active attempts transactionally. The `aetherflow-transport-nats` crate now integrates a real JetStream publisher and inbox-backed pull consumer. PostgreSQL 18 + NATS CI verifies the broker-accepted/outbox-ack retry boundary, stable message-ID deduplication, logical consumer deduplication, lease and AckWait heartbeat for long handlers, and failed-handler redelivery. The durable worker/coordinator remains an opt-in PostgreSQL execution path. OS-level process termination after broker storage and after inbox commit is now integration-tested on PostgreSQL 18 + NATS (run `41380067612`). Delivery remains at-least-once; external side effects require application-level idempotency or a transaction shared with inbox completion. M05 membership-gated task execution is verified on PostgreSQL 18 + NATS (41402000557) with Rust CI (41402000570). Tests cover stale-epoch write rejection, replacement-worker recovery after task-lease expiry, registry capability filtering, lease renewal while gracefully draining a long-running handler, UID-scoped packet-level PostgreSQL partition/rejoin, abrupt worker-process loss, three-member NATS quorum recovery, and the combined two-round chaos campaign. This is a verified durable execution vertical slice—not a production-ready distributed workflow engine. See [the PostgreSQL transaction contract](docs/persistence/postgres-transaction-contract.md).
