# AetherFlow

**A durable, distributed workflow execution platform built with Rust.**

AetherFlow is an open-source engineering project exploring reliable asynchronous execution across processes and machines. Its design centers on durable state transitions, explicit execution semantics, recoverable workers, and observable operations.

> **Project status:** Architecture and foundation phase. APIs and implementation details are not yet stable.

## Why AetherFlow?

Distributed work is easy to start and hard to make reliable. Processes crash, networks partition, workers disappear, messages are delivered more than once, and external side effects cannot always be rolled back. AetherFlow aims to make these realities explicit rather than hiding them behind a simplistic task queue.

## Design goals

- Durable workflow and task state with auditable transitions.
- At-least-once delivery paired with idempotent execution primitives.
- Recoverable workers using leases, heartbeats, and bounded retries.
- Explicit cancellation, timeout, concurrency, and backpressure semantics.
- A modular Rust core with async execution.
- A sandboxed WebAssembly extension boundary.
- Operational visibility through structured events, metrics, and traces.
- Reproducible tests for failure and recovery behavior.

AetherFlow will **not** claim universal exactly-once execution. External side effects require application-level idempotency or an explicit transactional integration.

## Planned technology

| Area | Direction |
|---|---|
| Core | Rust, Tokio |
| HTTP control API | Axum |
| RPC | Tonic / gRPC (when justified) |
| Durable storage | PostgreSQL |
| Event transport | NATS JetStream (after core semantics are proven) |
| Extensions | Wasmtime |
| Observability | OpenTelemetry |
| Dashboard | TypeScript UI (later phase) |
| Deployment | Docker Compose; Kubernetes only after operational needs are demonstrated |

Technology choices are provisional until validated by implementation and recorded in architecture decision records.

## Repository map

The repository is being built incrementally. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the authoritative checklist and current checkpoint, [docs/architecture/overview.md](docs/architecture/overview.md) for system boundaries, and [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/) for architecture decisions.

## Development status

No production-readiness or performance claims are made at this stage. Each milestone must include tests, documented behavior, and a reproducible verification command before it is marked complete.
